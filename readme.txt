"WordPress Plugin Template" is an object-oriented code template for any kind of WordPress plugin that includes built-in support for:

1. Custom post types with custom fields and custom taxonomies

Activating this plugin template in your WordPress dashboard will activate a new custom post type (identified as '*Posts' in the menu) as well as a new settings page (found at Settings > Plugin Settings).
